# Tricks 

__Running an experiment should be as easy as describing it in an YAML file.__

----------

A Tricks entry (TE) is a set of replicas/pods.
An experiment is one or more TE's.

### Features
- [x] Register occurrence of events. Each event has a counter associated.
- [x] Implicit events (`start` and `stop` of each pod in a TE)
- [x] Subscribe to events
  - can be used to implement synchronization barrier
    (e.g. make sure all clients start at the same time)
- [x] Workflow (e.g. only start a given TE once event X counter is Y)
- [ ] Pod discovery
- [ ] Log aggregation
- [ ] Plotting from logs (e.g. latency/throughput, CDF, bar, line)
- [ ] Detect coordination omission from logs
- [ ] Federation support (run across multiple Kubernetes clusters)
- [ ] Spot instances support (if an instance is killed, the experiment is restarted)

### Example

In this example, event `client1_stop` and `client2_stop`
are implicit events,
while `server-ready` is an event registered by replicas
in the `server` TE.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
experiment:
- tag: server
  image: vitorenesduarte/tricks-example
  replicas: 3
  env:
  - name: TYPE
    value: server
  workflow:
    stop:
      name: client2_stop
      value: 6
- tag: client1
  image: vitorenesduarte/tricks-example
  replicas: 3
  env:
  - name: TYPE
    value: client
  - name: OPS
    value: 100
  workflow:
    start:
      name: server-ready
      value: 3
- tag: client2
  image: vitorenesduarte/tricks-example
  replicas: 6
  env:
  - name: TYPE
    value: client
  - name: OPS
    value: 200
  workflow:
    start:
      name: client1_stop
      value: 3
```

# Environment variables

Configuration of pods is achieved through environment variables.
Some variable names are reserved and always defined in every pod:
- [x] `TAG`: from configuration file
- [ ] `REPLICAS`: from configuration file
- [x] `EXP_ID`: an experiment identifier generated by Tricks
- [x] `POD_ID`: unique (no other pod with the same `TAG` and `EXP_ID`
has the same id)
- [x] `POD_IP`: pod IP from Kubernetes
- [ ] `TRICKS_IP`: pod IP of Tricks
- [ ] `TRICKS_PORT`: port of Tricks 

# Drivers API

Methods will be tagged with __[CT]__ if it's a method from Clients to Tricks,
and with __[TC]__ if from Tricks to Clients.
